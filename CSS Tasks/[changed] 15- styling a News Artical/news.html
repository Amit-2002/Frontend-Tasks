        <p>India back in Maldives as S Jaishankar meets Mohamed Muizzu today</p>
        <p>External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Friday said India's partnership with the Maldives is based on its deep desire to work together for each other's welfare and interests, as he emphasised that the relationship with Male was one of the cornerstones of India's ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy.
            Jaishankar arrived in Male for a three-day official visit to reset the bilateral relationship with the Maldives, the first high-level trip from India after the archipelago nation's pro-China president Mohamed Muizzu assumed office last year.
