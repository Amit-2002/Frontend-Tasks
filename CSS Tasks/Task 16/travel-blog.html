        The Kinnaur Kailasha (locally known as Kinner Kailash) is a mountain in
        the Kinnaur district of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. As per
        Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva and goddess Parvati reside in Kinner
        Kailash.[2] It is the fourth most important peak among the group of five
        separate peaks in Himalayas in separate locations collectively known as
        the Panch Kailash or "Five Kailashas", other being Mount Kailash in
        first place, Adi Kailash in second, Shikhar Kailash (Shrikhand Mahadev
        Kailash) in third, and Manimahesh Kailash in fifth place in terms of
        importance.[3] As a result, it is deeply revered by Hindus. Kinnaur
        Kailash peak has a height of 6050 meters and is considered sacred by
        both Hindu and Buddhist Kinnauris. This mountain is sometimes confused
        with the Mount Kailash in Tibet. The monolithic pillar (Shivling) is
        located at an altitude of around 4800 meters.[4] The Kinnaur Kailash
        Range borders the district of Kinnaur in the south and is dominated by
        Jorkanden (elevation- 6473m) peaks.[1] Jorkanden is the highest peak in
        the Kinner-Kailash range.
