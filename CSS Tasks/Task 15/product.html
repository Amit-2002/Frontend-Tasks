    <h3>Study Table</h3>

    <!-- font-style and tet-align -->
    <p>
      Depending on the size of the room or the place where you want to place it
      you can get large l shaped study tables or rectangular or L-shaped ones.
      Study tables generally come with storage spaces as well where you can keep
      your notes books and important books for study.

      f you have a toddler at home or a kid below 6 years of age in your house,
      rather than using a study table try activity sets. You can shop for study
      table & chair sets from online stores if you want to browse through
      various types and categories. Activity sets come with a small table with
      four or two chairs along with it. It is meant for young learners of a
      specific age group, mainly toddlers. If you are thinking about exposing
      your child to lessons of learning and getting the habit of sitting at a
      study table from a pretty young age, then do not introduce them first to a
      study table. Instead opt for an activity set of chairs and tables. This is
      because study tables from the very beginning might seem a little
      intimidating to the child and even height adjustable study tables might
      not be able to give them the comfort that they are looking for. These sets
      come in various colours and designs and hence your kid will simply love to
      spend their time there and hence inculcate the importance of spending time
      doing fruitful and creative activities from a very early age. Thus, both
      these two types of tables have their own uses. So, when you want to buy
      either of them, keep the purpose and age of your child in mind.
